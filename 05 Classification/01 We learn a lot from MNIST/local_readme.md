### TL;DR

basically we start with fooling around with mnist dataset.

then we shuffled the dataset and introduce a alternative approach to shuffle datasets.

then we built a binary classifier with it, which classifies the given digit image is 'zero' or 'non-zero' number.

then, we discussed about 'Performance Measures' and it's methods to evaluate the accuracy.

then we  talked about 'Confusion Matrix' and we computed it using sklearn. metrics library. and then, we argued abour precision and reclall stuff and we all know: **Increasing precision make recall reduce and vice versa.** actually it's called precision/recall tradeoff.

and lastly we talked about "PR Curve", "Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve" and model comparison.
